### Project Description
A web-based snail speed tracking application that uses computer vision to measure the movement of snails in real-time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How fast do snails actually go? Nobody knew. Nobody dared to ask. And frankly, nobody cared... until we, the brave, the bold, the slightly unhinged, decided it was our sacred duty to find out.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Snailometer, A web app that measures the speed of a snail either using a webcam or you can even upload a video of a snail crawling  and it will show the live speed of the snail! 

## Technical Details
